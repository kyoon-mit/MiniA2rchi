# MiniA2rchi

This repository is a mini version of [A2rchi](https://github.com/mit-submit/A2rchi) that runs locally on my laptop.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is threefold.

1. For me to understand the structure of LLM-based services.
2. To expedite testing of new functionalities.
3. To build an application without relying on the slow development speed of the A2rchi team.
